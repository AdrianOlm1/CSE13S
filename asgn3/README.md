This code tests password tests 10 cases in test_password_checker.c. It calls a function in password_checker.c and password_checker.h that wil check if theres at least 1 upper case, 1 lower case, and 1 number. It will also check that your first or last name are not in the password. If any of these cases are not true, the check_password function will output false.

Function: This code works by typing make then ./password_checker into the directory where the file is.
